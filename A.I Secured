### 2. Firewall Integration
 Use a firewall API to dynamically add rules based on detecte
``python
ef block_ip(ip_address):
   # Send a command to the firewall to block the IP address
   print(f"Blocking IP address: {ip_address}")
``
### 3. Traffic Monitoring
``python
ef monitor_network():
   while True:
       traffic = capture_network_traffic()
       ai_bot.analyze_traffic(traffic)
``
